== MockieMinimal.AdiumMessageStyle
I like Adium's Mockie message style, but I like it more with a few things
hidden.  Just tossing this up here so  I don't have to keep copying my changes
around.  See sample.png


== Install
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Message\ Styles/
git clone git://github.com/fixlr/mockieminimal.adiummessagestyle.git \
  MockieMinimal.AdiumMessageStyle
